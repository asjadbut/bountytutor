# BountyTutor

BountyTutor is an **open source** interactive learning platform for security vulnerabilities, inspired by [buggenie](https://github.com/your-org/buggenie). Instead of generating bug bounty reports, BountyTutor helps users understand, reproduce, and learn about real-world vulnerabilities across platforms and categories.
